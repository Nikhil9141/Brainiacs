                Amazon is a global e-commerce, cloud computing, and technology company, founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994, in Bellevue, Washington. Initially launched as an online bookstore, Amazon quickly expanded its product offerings to include electronics, apparel, furniture, and nearly every consumer product imaginable. The company's mission is to be "Earth's most customer-centric company," focusing on convenience, low prices, and fast delivery.

                Amazon has played a pivotal role in revolutionizing e-commerce and logistics, becoming synonymous with online shopping. Its innovative services, like Amazon Prime, introduced features such as same-day delivery and streaming, transforming customer expectations and creating a loyal subscriber base. Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS), launched in 2006, has become a leader in cloud computing, offering services like storage, computing power, and machine learning. AWS is a major profit driver and supports businesses of all sizes globally.

                The company has also expanded into hardware with products like Kindle e-readers, Echo smart speakers, and Fire TV devices, integrating them with its proprietary AI assistant, Alexa. Other ventures include Amazon Fresh for groceries, Amazon Studios for original content, and investments in futuristic technologies such as drones and automation.

                As of 2024, Andy Jassy is Amazon's CEO, having taken over from Jeff Bezos on July 5, 2021. Bezos remains involved as the Executive Chairman of the Board. Under Jassy’s leadership, Amazon continues to focus on expanding its core businesses while pushing into newer territories such as artificial intelligence and sustainability.
